                  It all started in the bustling streets of Hyderabad in the year 1900, when our founder, 
                  Sri Kotaiah, opened a small sweet shop with nothing but a dream and traditional recipes 
                  passed down through generations. What began as a humble venture to bring authentic 
                  Indian sweets to the local community has grown into a legacy that continues to thrive today.
